‚ù§Ô∏è I am a full-stack senior software engineer located in Cologne. Whilst living a great passion for frontend development, I really love to implement backends filling their counterpart with data and business processes.

Also, my ability to develop databases and the surrounding infrastructure make me feel like I have developed something complete when finishing a product.

In my free time, I fulfil my passion to coding, cars, music and video games.

I would describe myself as a team-player, being in love with hand-in-hand work. For example, developing against other developers' machines is really fun to me!

Today, I am working for [Trusted Shops](https://github.com/trustedshops), responsible for **_building a pluggable micro-frontend platform_** and reusable libraries together with my current team.

## My experience of the past years

In the past years, I have been working on several things and target devices. This includes hybrid and native mobile apps, web apps, hybrid native desktop apps, rich clients, websites and many more things.

Backend-wise I have created different systems with NodeJS, C# and a little Java. This all includes a bunch of REST-Apis, Database Backends and even Database Driven Business Logic.

I have seen and worked on different infrastructural approaches, such as on-premise, self-hosted SaaS or even AWS Cloudbased systems!

To only mention some of the projects, I have been working on:

- Integration of two fully independent but complementing systems to build an end-to-end use case. Implemented using ASP.NET Web APIs
- Build a user backend for self-servicing using Angular
- Redesign & Develop a SEO aware website using Angular Universal
- Build a reusable micro-frontend platform offering all common services and features to make other teams keep focussing on their business product. Created in a technology agnostic way, utilizing AWS, NPM, Angular, React, Preact and many more.
- Create a reusable control library, implementing the companys CI/CD. Built using Web Components.
- Implement a Mobile Hybrid App using Capacitor/Cordova, offering push notifications and native device integration
- Build REST APIs based on Node.js, hosted in Amazon Web Services using Api Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda and more
- Design and implement a modular documentation platform for providing different documentation artifacts like OpenAPI Specs, Markdown Freetext or HTML pages. All done using Amazon Web Services like S3, Lambdas, Cloudfront and more.
