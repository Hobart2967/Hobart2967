‚ù§Ô∏è I am a full-stack senior software engineer located in Cologne. Whilst living a great passion for frontend development, I really love to implement backends filling their counterpart with data and business processes.

Also, my ability to develop databases and the surrounding infrastructure make me feel like I have developed something complete when finishing a product.

In my free time, I fulfil my passion to coding, cars, music and video games.

I would describe myself as a team-player, being in love with hand-in-hand work. For example, developing against other developers' machines is really fun to me!

Today, I am working for [Trusted Shops](https://github.com/trustedshops), responsible for **_building a pluggable micro-frontend platform_** and reusable libraries together with my current team.
